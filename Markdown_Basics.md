# Markdown Basics

## Headlines, paragraphs and other formatting

### Headlines

#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
##### Heading level 6


### Paragraphs and Line Breaks
Create paragraphs by typing the way we would in any other program. Just hit return twice to start another paragraph.

Where you see empty space between blocks of text in the markdown document, you will see empty space separating those blocks of text in your formatted HTML document.

### Slim Shady using double space + enter
May I have your attention please?  
May I have your attention please?  
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?  
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?  
We're going to have a problem here

#### Italics

This asterisk *works* and this underscore _works_ too.

#### Bold

This double-asterisk **works** and this underscore __works__ too. But be ***consistent***!

> When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. - *Paulo Coelho*

### Code

To install a latest versinon of NPM, you can type `npm install npm@latest -g`

This is how a code block looks like with syntax highlighting:
```Javascript
const exampleFunction = ()=> {
    console.log("example");
}
```
